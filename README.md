## Go Back N File Transfer

This is a basic TCP/UDP File Transfer program written in python.

The core is from a project for my networking class.

Currently the program is terminal based

I will be incorporating a GUI to make the user experience more enjoyable.

## Instructions

To use, in terminal navigate to folder containing transfer.py and gobackn.py

-Run commmand "python transfer.py" (there must be two instances for transfer to work correctly)

-Pick to either SEND or RECEIVE a file

-Input the interface/host (ip of server)

-Select port for the transfer server

-Select file to be sent/ where to save file that is received

**Any file used to save will be overwritten!**
